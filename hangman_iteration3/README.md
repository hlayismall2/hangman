# Problems - Hangman Iteration 3 Loops

* The player makes guesses one letter at a time until they win or die. We also draw the hangman with each guess so that the player knows how many chances are left.

### To Run

* `python3 hangman.py`
* follow the input prompts to play the game

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_main.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_main.MyTestCase.test_step1`
